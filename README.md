# DICOM Structured Reports for ProstateX

This repository contains the code used to create DICOM Structured Reports for the ProstateX collection. The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) holds csv files that provide data about the target biopsy points, Gleason grade, and findings. However, having this data as csv files makes it not easily searchable, and usable. Therefore, to promote standardization, we create Structured Reports holding the finding information.
